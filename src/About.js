                But I must explain to you how all this mistaken 
                idea of denouncing of a pleasure and praising 
                pain was born and I will give you a complete 
                account of the system, and expound the actual 
                teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
                the master-builder of human happiness: dat ass.

                To take a trivial example, which of us ever 
                undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to 
                obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right 
                to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a 
                pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one 
                who avoids a pain that produces no resultant 
                pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with 
                righteous indignation and dislike men who are so 
                beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of 
                the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
                foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to 
                ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
                in their duty through weakness of will, which is the 
                same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. 
                These cases are perfectly simple and easy to 
                distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of 
                choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our 
                being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is 
                to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain 
                circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or 
                the obligations.
